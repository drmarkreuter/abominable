  <h3>
    Do you see the swing in the playground rocking gently to and fro?<br>
    The little boot prints that encircle the slide's perimeter of January snow<br>
    Do you doubt your senses, are you losing your mind?<br>
    It's not what you think, it’s just the winter wind.<br>
    <br>
    Do you see the swing in the playground rocking gently to and fro?<br>
    In the April eve, the breeze plays the tree’s leaves like a percussion player pro<br>
    Do you hear those music box chimes, sweet and delicate?<br>
    It's not what you think, you've just imagined it.<br>
    <br>
    Do you see the swing in the playground rocking gently to and fro?<br>
    In the Autumn cool, sycamore seeds whirl towards the spot where new trees will one day grow<br>
    She sits holding iron chain with a gaze that stings like thorn of rosebush<br>
    whisper a prayer to your God, and then give her a push.<br>

    <h3>
      Crimson carpet and deco glass<br>
      Ascending steps and endless corridor<br>
      Perfume of pine and black narcissus<br>
      Nothing but blood and a hundred locked doors<br>
      <br>
      Cardinal tears on jacket of hide<br>
      Red iron art imitates floral decor<br>
      Walls and windows, access denied<br>
      Nothing but blood and a thousand locked doors<br>
      <br>
      Distant ping of elevator bell<br>
      You’ve seen these maze of walls before<br>
      Endless roaming through this banal hell<br>
      Nothing but blood and a million locked doors<br>
      <br>
      Nothing but blood and one locked door<br>
      Nothing but blood and one locked door<br>
      Nothing but blood and one locked door<br>

      <h4>
        The Street seems quiet tonight<br>
        leafy puddles are full-moon bright<br>
        Cats and foxes brave to explore<br>
        the rubbish bin's secret store<br>
        <br>
        The street seems quiet tonight<br>
        drizzle dances in golden lamp-light<br>
        Green boxes, full of glass<br>
        and cardboard origami masterclass<br>
        <br>
        The street seems quiet tonight<br>
        houses lit by cathode delight<br>
        the devil's car drops its fare<br>
        beneath the stoned angels glare<br>
